About me
======
Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying Computer Science & Mathematics.
In parallel, I've been working as a research assistant at the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) Lab, advised by Prof.[Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). I'm currently doing a summer internship at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) under Dr.[Qi Sun](https://qisun.me/) and Dr.[Xin Sun](http://www.sunxin.name/).
