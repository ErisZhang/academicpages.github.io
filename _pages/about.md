About me
======
Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
In parallel, I've been working as a research assistant at the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) Lab, advised by Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). Currently I'm doing a summer internship at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) under Dr. [Qi Sun](https://qisun.me/) and Dr. [Xin Sun](http://www.sunxin.name/).

I'm broadly interested in physics-based animation, geometry processing, computational fabrication, interactive graphics and user interfaces that augment creativity and productivity.

Previously, I've explored different research areas with Prof. [Ken Jackson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krj/) on numerical analysis and with Prof. [Fanny Chevalier](http://fannychevalier.net/) on HCI / visualization. I also did research in geometric modeling with Prof. [Marc Alexa](https://www.eecs.tu-berlin.de/cg-archiv/menue/team/alexa/) and physics-based animation with Prof. [David Levin](http://diwlevin.webfactional.com/researchdb/) and Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). It's my great honour to be selected as a finalist for [CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/) 2020 and an awardee for [Adobe Research Women-in Technology Scholarship](https://adoberesearch.ctlprojects.com/scholarship/previous-scholarship-award-winners/) 2020.

<div style="font-size:12pt"><strong>Fast Updates for Least-Squares Rotational Alignment</strong></div>
<div style="font-size:10pt">Across computer graphics, vision, robotics and simulation, many applications rely on determining the 3D rotation that aligns two objects or sets of points. The de facto solution is to use singular value decomposition (SVD), where the optimal rotation is recovered as the product of the singular vectors. While correct, we observe that SVD computes much more information than necessary to build the optimal rotation. In this project, we propose a novel way for efficiently computing updates for least-squares rotational alignment problems. We show that a single Newton-like step is sufficient for small-rotation settings and further optimize implementation using AVX vectorization. </div>
