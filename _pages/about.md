About me
======
Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying Computer Science & Mathematics.
In parallel, I've been working as a research assistant at the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) Lab, advised by Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). Currently I'm doing a summer internship at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) under Dr. [Qi Sun](https://qisun.me/) and Dr. [Xin Sun](http://www.sunxin.name/).

I'm broadly interested in physics-based animation, geometry processing, numerical simulation, interactive graphics and user interfaces that augment creativity and productivity.

Previously, I've explored different research areas with Prof. [Ken Jackson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krj/) on numerical analysis and Prof. [Fanny Chevalier](http://fannychevalier.net/) on HCI / visualization. I also did research in geometric modeling with Prof. [Marc Alexa](https://www.eecs.tu-berlin.de/cg-archiv/menue/team/alexa/) and physics-based animation with Prof. [David Levin](http://diwlevin.webfactional.com/researchdb/) and Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). It's my honour to be selected as a finalist for [CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/) 2020 and an awardee for [Adobe Research Women-in Technology Scholarship](https://adoberesearch.ctlprojects.com/scholarship/previous-scholarship-award-winners/) 2020.
