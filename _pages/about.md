About me
======
Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying Computer Science & Mathematics.
In parallel, I've been working as a research assistant at the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) Lab, advised by Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). I'm currently doing a summer internship at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) under Dr. [Qi Sun](https://qisun.me/) and Dr. [Xin Sun](http://www.sunxin.name/).

I'm broadly interested in physics-based animation, geometry processing, numerical simulation, interactive graphics and user interfaces that augment creativity and productivity.

Previously, I've explored topics in different research areas with numerous professors, including Prof. [Ken Jackson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krj/) on numerical analysis, Prof. [Anastasia Bezerianos](https://www.lri.fr/~anab/) and Prof. [Fanny Chevalier](http://fannychevalier.net/) on HCI / visualization, Prof. [Marc Alexa](https://www.eecs.tu-berlin.de/cg-archiv/menue/team/alexa/), Prof. [David Levin](http://diwlevin.webfactional.com/researchdb/) and Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/) on geometry modeling and physical simulation.
